# Problem Statement
“Write a computer program using any compiled language, such as C/C++, Java, FORTRAN, etc. ( not interpreted language such as Matlab, Python, Octave, Scilab, etc.) That takes in two inputs x and y and returns a value that is x raised to the power y. The inputs x and y can be any valid real numbers.”

# The Math
Start with an equation for the problem definition
$$\begin{equation}
a = x^y
\end{equation}

Let $$\begin{equation} y = N + d \end{equation}
$$ X^Y, \text{ where } \lbrace X,Y \in \mathbb{R} \rbrace $$
